# A Rust Wrapper for the OpenAI API

I've never written an API Wrapper before but I figured I'd give it a shot

## Priority of Endpoints

I am going to start out with the `Models` and the `Completions` endpoints. But even before I get
to actually implementing those, I have to figure a basic PoC of authenticating with the OpenAI API
