An Wrapper library for the OpenAI API written in Rust

## Endpoint Implementation Progress

- [x] List Models
- [x] Retrieve Model
- [x] Create Completion
- [ ] Create Chat completion | _in progress_
- [ ] Create Edit
- [ ] Create Image

## Priority of Endpoints

Some endpoints are easier than others to implement.
I am going to start out with the `Models` and the `Completions` endpoints. But even before I get to actually implementing those, I have to figure a basic PoC of authenticating with the OpenAI API
